            <h2>XAML</h2>
            <p>Avalonia uses a XAML dialect that should feel immediately familiar to anyone coming from WPF, UWP and Xamarin Forms.
            <p>Avalonia supports binding, MVVM, lookless controls and data templates just as you'd expect from a XAML framework.

        <div class="col-md-4 text-justify">
            <h2>Cross Platform</h2>
            <p>We support Windows, Linux and OSX with experimental mobile support for Android and iOS.
            <p>We currently have Win32, GTK3 and MonoMac windowing backends plus Direct2D and Skia renderers.

    <h2>Current Status</h2>

    We're currently in a beta phase, which means that the framework is generally usable for writing applications, but there may be some bugs
    and breaking changes as we continue development.
